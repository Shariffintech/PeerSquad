Peer to peer strategy review portal

Welcome to the Student Strategies portal! This project was created under the principle of boosting collaboration and continuity among key stakeholders processes when capturing, organizing and synthesizing essential data used to promote the academic, behavioral, and social emotional competence of children and youth.

Student Strategies is a peer to peer strategy review portal that allows students to review strategies and provide feedback on their own. The portal is designed to be used by teachers, parents, and administrators to review strategies and provide feedback on studentsâ€™ strategies.

This app does not require any prior knowledge of the strategies being reviewed and does not require user authentication.
